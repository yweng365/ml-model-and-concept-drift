# 3. Techniques to Adapt to Drift

After the detection of drift, we look into the techniques to effectively adapt to model and concept drift. Depending on the nature of the drift, several strategies can be used. We will then introduce some strategies, grouping into four categories ———— general adaptation strategies, deep learning-specific methods,ensemble methods, and evaluation approaches to ensure model resilience.

## 3.1 General Adaptation Strategies

Since machine learning algorithms usually optimize an objective function against a static training set, the idea is to perform modifications to apply them on evolving data. In this paper, wee propose six different modifying strategies. In each of the strategies, the suitable situation is listed.

- **Detect and Increment**: This approach uses a drift detector to monitor model performance continuously and incrementally updates model parameters with new data. The model is updated only if drift is detected, with the
pipelines trained incrementally with the latest s (sliding window) batchesIt is suitable for gradual drift without significant changes to the model configuration.

- **Detect and Retrain**: When drift is detected, the model is retrained from scratch using the most recent data while keeping the original structure intact. This ensures that the model is up-to-date with recent data patterns and works effectively for moderate changes.

- **Detect and Warm-Start**: Upon drift detection, the AutoML process is re-run with a warm start, building on the best previously evaluated configurations. This technique is well-suited for moderate drift scenarios where the existing model needs slight optimization.

- **Detect and Restart**: In the case of major drift, this approach involves re-running the entire AutoML process from scratch, completely re-optimizing the model. This method is computationally intensive but necessary for significant data distribution changes.

- **Periodic Restart**: The AutoML process is periodically re-run at fixed intervals regardless of drift detection. This ensures that the model remains consistently updated, which is useful in highly dynamic environments but can be resource-heavy.

- **Train Once**: As a baseline, the model is trained initially and not updated further. This approach serves as a benchmark for comparing how well adaptive strategies perform against a static model.

## 3.2 Deep Learning-Specific Adaptation Techniques

- **Model Parameter Updating**: This technique involves updating model weights in response to drift while maintaining the same network architecture. It is effective for incremental and gradual drift scenarios.
  - *Fully Parameter Updating*: Updates all model parameters using new data, ensuring complete adaptation but potentially suffering from slow convergence.
  - *Partially Parameter Updating*: Updates only selected parameters, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting and provides faster adaptation.

- **Model Structure Updating**: This approach adjusts the architecture of the neural network to handle drift more effectively. It is particularly useful for addressing complex or multiple types of drift.
  - *Network Width Adjusting*: Adds units or branches to the existing network structure, allowing the model to adapt incrementally to new data distributions.
  - *Network Depth Adjusting*: Adds layers to the network, enhancing adaptability to abrupt and recurrent drift.

## 3.3 Ensemble Methods for Drift Adaptation

- **Adaptive and Dynamic Ensemble (ADE-SVM)**: This method involves an ensemble of support vector machines that adapts over time to account for new data batches and changing financial distress concepts. The model adapts to drift by:
  - *Incrementally Updating Base SVMs*: The candidate SVMs are incrementally updated using the latest data batches, ensuring the ensemble remains relevant for financial risk prediction as data changes.
  - *Dynamic Selection of SVMs*: Base SVMs are adaptively selected based on their predictive ability and classifier diversity. This helps maintain an optimal combination of models to handle the evolving data distributions.
  - *Time Window Approach*: A time window is applied to determine the relevance of new data batches, and older data that may no longer be informative is excluded. This ensures that only the most recent, relevant data influences the model's decision-making.
  - *Dynamic Weighting*: Base SVMs are dynamically weighted according to their validation performance on the latest data, which enhances the ensemble's adaptability and predictive accuracy in real-world settings.

- **Super-Ensemble Methods**: Super-ensemble techniques involve combining multiple models to create a robust prediction. These ensembles adapt to drift by dynamically updating the weights of individual models or by assimilating new data continuously. The idea is to leverage diverse model strengths to improve resilience to various types of drift, including surface drift prediction and concept drift.

## 3.4 Evaluating and Adapting Resistance to Model Drift

Evaluating and adapting model resistance to drift is crucial to ensure robustness, especially in high-stakes environments. Adaptation strategies should also consider the model's ability to defend against adversarial influences and maintain stability under evolving conditions.

- **Adversarial Drift and Adaptation**: Machine learning models in sensitive environments can be vulnerable to adversarial drift, where crafted data points are introduced to induce incorrect classifications. To adapt to such drifts, models can be enhanced with techniques such as adversarial training, which involves training the model on adversarial examples to improve robustness. This is particularly important for domains such as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and fraud detection.

- **Monte Carlo Simulation for Drift Evaluation**: Monte Carlo simulations can be utilized not only to evaluate susceptibility to drift but also to test different adaptive strategies under varying conditions. By repeatedly sampling and testing configurations, it is possible to identify optimal adaptation methods and enhance model resilience against drift, including adversarial scenarios.

- **Adaptive Evaluation Techniques**: Evaluating model resistance to drift requires adaptive approaches such as:
  - *Centroid Anomaly Detection*: Continuously adjusts centroids based on new data to detect anomalous shifts in distribution, providing an early indication of drift.
  - *Adaptive SVM and HMM*: Support vector machines and hidden Markov models can be adapted to enhance resilience to concept drift. Adaptive SVMs use incremental learning to update support vectors with new information, while HMMs leverage ensemble methods to improve stability in dynamic settings. These techniques are particularly valuable for maintaining model performance in scenarios with evolving data distributions.
